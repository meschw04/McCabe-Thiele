Run Requirements: Anaconda with Jupyter implementation (Python 2), numpy, pandas, and perhaps a few other libraries depending on your distribution.

This code repository is specifically designed with a particular problem in mind, but can be easily generalized for solving for different systems by simply changing the data fed into the system at various steps. The specific case that this repository is designed for, however, is for the distillation experiment performed in Dr. James Gerstle's Unit Operations II class at the University of Louisville. If you are a student or TA in this class, you should be able to enter your own datasets in for the presets in the Python Notebook. I would emphasize the importance of making sure that you have sufficiently been through the formulas in the McCabe and Smith textbook, and that you not use this code unless you can first reason out what the code is doing and why.

I recognize that there are significant issues with this code, however since the main purpose was for generating figures and running calculations, I was less concerned with good coding practices and more concerned with functionality. If you can do better, feel free to make a pull request. I appreciate any input and will take the time to evaluate it.

Note that if you are a student who takes the time to manually enter your dataset and run then into an error, you will need to try to fix it yourself before reaching out to me. THIS IS NOT A CALCULATIONS SHORTCUT, this is for people who know their way around Python and can use this as a template for their own creations. If you have any issues you cannot solve as you work with this repository, please form a GitHub ticket under "Issues". I will attempt to get back to these issues in a timely manner. You may also try emailing me at meschw04@louisville.edu if you have other questions.

Happy coding!

Marcus Schwarting
